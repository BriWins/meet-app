 ### User Stories
    
    1. As a user, I would like to be able to filter events by city so that I can see the list of events that
    take place in that city.
    2. As a user, I would like to be able to show/hide event details so that I can see more/less
    information about an event.
    3. As a user, I would like to be able to specify the number of events I want to view in the app so
    that I can see more or fewer events in the events list at once.
    4. As a user, I would like to be able to use the app when offline so that I can see the events I
    viewed the last time I was online.
    5. As a user, I would like to be able to add the app shortcut to my home screen so that I can
    open the app faster.
    6. As a user, I would like to be able to see a chart showing the upcoming events in each city so
    that I know what events are organized in which city.
